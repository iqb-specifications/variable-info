This package contains of the data specification for Verona API: Variable Info (to be used as an array).

* JSON Schema (see `variable-info.schema.json`)
* Schema documentation based on [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator)
* type definitions for TypeScript (see npm-link above)

## Variable identifier validation

Variable ids and aliases may contain ASCII letters, digits, `_` and `-`. They must contain at least one
character and have no technical maximum length. Values are validated as supplied; they are not trimmed or
renamed.

The package exports `isValidVariableIdentifier(value)` for individual values and
`validateVariableList(variables)` for complete lists. List validation returns machine-readable errors for
empty or malformed identifiers, duplicate ids, duplicate aliases and collisions between public identifiers.
Comparisons are case-insensitive. A variable's public identifier is its alias when present and its id otherwise.
The package also contains `variable-validation-cases.json` as a shared conformance suite for implementations.
